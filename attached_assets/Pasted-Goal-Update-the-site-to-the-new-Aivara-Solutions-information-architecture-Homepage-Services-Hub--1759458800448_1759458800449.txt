Goal: Update the site to the new Aivara Solutions information architecture (Homepage + Services Hub + Division pages + Aivara Music landing) using the existing visual style (fonts, spacing, components) and current color tokens/variables. Do not change the brand palette or global styles; reuse existing components where possible.

Before you code:

Detect the stack (Next.js/React/Tailwind or plain HTML/CSS, etc.).

Reuse current layout, header, footer, button, card, grid utilities.

Keep current SEO config (title template, OpenGraph), only extend with new copy below.

1) Navigation

Primary nav (order): Home, Services, Portfolio, Blog (if exists), Contact.

Services gets a dropdown with: AI & Education, Web & Marketing, Logistics, Aivara Music.

Use existing NavBar component; only add routes/links.

2) Homepage (new sections, same style)

Keep hero + current look; replace headlines with:

Hero H1: “Technology + Creativity for the Modern Business.”

Subhead: “AI & Education • Web & Marketing • Logistics • Aivara Music”

Hero CTA buttons: “Explore Services” (links to /services) and “Get a Quote” (links to /contact).

Add a 4-card Services Overview section under hero (reuse existing Card component and current colors):

Card 1 (AI & Education): short text = “Onboarding, automation, and beginner-friendly training.” Link /services/ai-education.

Card 2 (Web & Marketing): “Websites, SEO, branding, and growth campaigns.” Link /services/web-marketing.

Card 3 (Logistics): “Last-mile, routing, and operational tech.” Link /services/logistics.

Card 4 (Aivara Music): “Custom jingles and sound identity for brands.” Link /services/music.

Add a Selected Work / Portfolio teaser (3–6 items, use existing PortfolioCard): include a filter bar with categories: All | AI | Web | Logistics | Music. Clicking “View All Work” goes to /portfolio.

Add a Strip CTA near footer:

Headline: “One team. Many ways to win.”

Button: “Book a discovery call” → /contact.

3) Services Hub (/services)

Build a grid of four service cards (same component as Homepage) with longer blurbs and a secondary CTA:

AI & Education → “Automation audits, starter playbooks, team training.”

Web & Marketing → “Full-stack sites, conversion copy, SEO, paid social.”

Logistics → “Dispatch workflows, tracking, analytics.”

Aivara Music → “Theme songs, jingles, background tracks, licensing.”
Each card: Primary CTA “Learn more” → respective detail page.

4) Division Pages (new routes)

Create four pages under /services/:

/services/ai-education

/services/web-marketing

/services/logistics

/services/music (Aivara Music landing)

Shared page layout: sticky page title, intro paragraph, bullet services list, 2–4 case study tiles, FAQ accordion, contact CTA block.

Copy blocks (use as placeholders, keep typography as is):

AI & Education – Intro: “We turn AI into practical wins: audits, simple automations, and hands-on training your team can actually use.”
Bullets: “Automation setup • Onboarding playbooks • Team workshops • Tool selection & governance”

Web & Marketing – Intro: “Websites and campaigns built for speed, clarity, and conversions—backed by clean engineering and sharp messaging.”
Bullets: “Web design/dev • SEO & analytics • Brand identity • Performance marketing”

Logistics – Intro: “From dispatch to doorstep, we streamline routes, tracking, and ops dashboards to cut costs and missed windows.”
Bullets: “Route planning • Driver ops • Tracking dashboards • Systems integration”

Aivara Music – Intro: “Your brand’s sound identity—custom jingles, themes, and background tracks that make people remember you.”
Bullets: “Custom jingles • Theme songs • Background loops • Licensing & deliverables”

5) Aivara Music page extras (/services/music)

Audio player section: reusable component that lists tracks from a local JSON (e.g. /data/music.json) with fields: { title, client, src, cover, tags }.

Video/Reel embed grid: accept shortlinks (TikTok/IG/YouTube).

Portfolio grid: tiles show client logo/name + play button.

“Order Your Jingle” CTA: button → /contact or /quote?service=music.

Optional: mini form inline (name, brand, use-case, vibe, deadline); submit to existing forms endpoint.

6) Portfolio page (/portfolio)

Add a category filter (AI | Web | Logistics | Music).

Each item supports optional audio/video preview if category = Music.

Keep existing card design and spacing.

7) Routing & Files

Create routes as needed. If using Next.js:

app/services/page.tsx (hub)

app/services/(ai-education|web-marketing|logistics|music)/page.tsx

Reuse components/Card, components/Section, components/FAQ, components/AudioPlayer.

If plain HTML, add services/index.html and four subpages; reuse CSS classes.

8) Content & Assets

Add /data/music.json with 6–12 sample entries (use existing media folder paths).

Do not hardcode colors; use the current CSS variables/tokens (e.g., --brand, --accent, etc.).

Icons: reuse your icon set; if none, use existing SVG system.

9) SEO / Meta

Homepage meta description: “Aivara Solutions blends AI, web & marketing, logistics, and custom music to grow modern businesses.”

Each service page gets a concise meta description and OpenGraph image (reuse existing OG template).

10) Performance & QA

No layout shifts; preserve current container widths and breakpoints.

Ensure keyboard focus, aria-labels on audio controls, alt text on thumbnails.

Lighthouse ≥ 90 for Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices.

Deliverables: updated pages, routes, components, and sample data wired to UI, with all styles consistent with the current site.
